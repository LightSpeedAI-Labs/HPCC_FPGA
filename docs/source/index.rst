HPCC FPGA Documentation
=============================================

This repository contains a more detailed documentation of the HPC Challenge Benchmark for FPGA.
In contrast to the code documentation maintained using doxygen, this documentation focuses on a broader picture for all benchmarks.
This inculdes more detailed description of the benchmark implementations, the configuration options and their impact on performance 
and resource usage, and performance results for selected FPGAs with the used configurations.
